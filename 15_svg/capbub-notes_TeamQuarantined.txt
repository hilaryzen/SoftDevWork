Predictions:
- The user will be alerted in some way by pressing on a Name

Observations:
- When clicking on a name, you get a pop up saying this page says 'name'
- nothing else happens unless you click the 6 names

2
Predictions:
- There will  be 3 pop ups instead of one because there are 3 events for clicky now.
- unsure of what they will display though

Observations:
- there are 3 consecutive pop ups after one click.
- first one shows name, second shows row, third shows all.

3
Predictions:
- The order they will show is the name (td) row (tr) then everything (body)
- stopPropagation will stop td and tr from giving alerts.

Observations:
- Order that they showed was body, td, then tr.
- Stop propagation stops td and tr.

4
Predictions:
-Stop propagation will stop td and tr from giving alerts
-I don't think the events listed ordered will not matter.
-there will be 3 pop ups with the same order as before.

Observations:
-The order does not matter.
-Not putting stop propagation makes the order the same as before.
